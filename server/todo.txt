Futher improvement:
Host the server on a public ip & domain (Can be accessed from anywhere)
    - We have access to the CSE Servers, could maybe host there
Get a verified SSL certificate (Can be accessed from any device without prior configuration of local certificate)
    - Cloudflare offers free SSL certificates
Speed up model inference time (Allow for real time card tracking)
    - It's faster ran on the umn server, would be even faster with CUDA, maybe other possibilities
Speed up model training time (I don't have to wait hours)
    - Need to get pytorch working with CUDA on the umn server
Basically all of these improvements involve taking the server off my laptop and running it on 
a dedicated machine with a GPU, but this might be impossible to do on university servers?
Cloudflared tunneling solves all of the above problems, it will route traffic back to the server
behind its router and firewall and will do so with a valid domain and ssl certificate
Now anyone can connect to the blackjack camera server with no prior configuration and inference
will be faster
Required Functionality:
Improve accuracy of model
    - Train model for longer
    - Find pre trained models that are better
Fix everything with the table and assigning cards, 
get screen working, 
try and run on server for speed (tunneling, need to modify WSS code a tad)
Assigning cards:
Say out of the last 30 hands detected the mode was detected >= 15 times and it contains >3 cards, we're good to go
Split screen into two regions, one is dealer's side and the other is player's side
Currently I'm ignoring >1 of the same card but that could be another check to throw out a result
