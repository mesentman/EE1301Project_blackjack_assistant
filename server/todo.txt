Futher improvement:
Host the server on a public ip & domain (Can be accessed from anywhere)
    - We have access to the CSE Servers, could maybe host there
Get a verified SSL certificate (Can be accessed from any device without prior configuration of local certificate)
    - Cloudflare offers free SSL certificates
Speed up model inference time (Allow for real time card tracking)
    - It's faster ran on the umn server, would be even faster with CUDA, maybe other possibilities
Speed up model training time (I don't have to wait hours)
    - Need to get pytorch working with CUDA on the umn server
Basically all of these improvements involve taking the server off my laptop and running it on 
a dedicated machine with a GPU, but this might be impossible to do on university servers?
Cloudflared tunneling solves all of the above problems, it will route traffic back to the server
behind its router and firewall and will do so with a valid domain and ssl certificate
Now anyone can connect to the blackjack camera server with no prior configuration and inference
will be faster
Required Functionality:
Improve accuracy of model
    - Train model for longer
Send data over to Photon (Makes the project actually work)
    - Using Particle function with output from YOLO model
