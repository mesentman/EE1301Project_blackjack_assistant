Futher improvement:
Host the server on a public ip (Can be accessed from anywhere)
    - We have access to the CSE Servers, could maybe host there
Get a verified SSL certificate (Can be accessed from any device without prior configuration of local certificate)
    - Cloudflare offers free SSL certificates
Speed up model inference time (Allow for real time card tracking)
    - It's faster ran on the umn server, would be even faster with CUDA, maybe other possibilities
Speed up model training time (I don't have to wait hours)
    - Need to get pytorch working with CUDA on the umn server
Basically all of these improvements involve taking the server off my laptop and running it on 
a dedicated machine with a GPU, but this might be impossible to do on university servers?
Required Functionality:
Improve accuracy of model
    - Train model for longer
Send data over to Photon (Makes the project actually work)
    - Using Particle function with output from YOLO model
